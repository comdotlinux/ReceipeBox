# Recipe Collection PWA - Project Status & Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL TESTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**MANDATORY: Claude must ALWAYS provide accurate, truthful test results**

1. **NEVER claim tests are passing without actually running them**
2. **ALWAYS report the exact test results - both passes AND failures**
3. **NEVER misrepresent test status or hide failures**
4. **If you haven't run tests, explicitly state that**
5. **Show actual command output, not summaries**

**Historical Issue**: On July 27, 2025, Claude repeatedly claimed "all E2E tests passing" when 16/77 E2E tests were actually failing. This created false confidence in the codebase and was completely unacceptable. Claude must be completely honest about test status at all times.

**Testing Protocol**:
- Run actual commands: `npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`
- Report exact numbers: "X passed, Y failed" 
- Show failure details when tests fail
- Never claim "all tests working" unless literally all tests pass

**Database Migration Protocol**:
- **NEVER modify existing migration files** - they have already been applied
- **NEVER edit migrations that start with 175*** - these are applied to production
- If schema changes are needed, create NEW migration files with higher timestamps
- Always backup database before applying new migrations

cd docker/

# Build and start services
docker-compose up --build -d

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

#### Manual Docker Commands

```bash
# Build frontend image
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.frontend -t myrecipebox-frontend .

# Run PocketBase container (using custom v0.29.0 image)
docker run -d \
  --name myrecipebox-pocketbase \
  -p 8090:8090 \
  -v pocketbase_data:/pb_data \
  myrecipebox-pocketbase:latest

# Run frontend container
docker run -d \
  --name myrecipebox-frontend \
  -p 3000:3000 \

  myrecipebox-frontend
```

### Key Deployment Files

- `docker/docker-compose.yml` - Production Docker Compose configuration
- `docker/Dockerfile.frontend` - Frontend container build configuration
- `scripts/migrate.sh` - Database migration script
- `scripts/backup.sh` - Automated backup script
- `scripts/restore.sh` - Backup restoration script

### Initial Setup Steps

1. **Prepare Environment**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /opt/myrecipebox
   cd /opt/myrecipebox
   git clone https://github.com/comdotlinux/ReceipeBox.git .
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with your settings
   ```

3. **Deploy with Docker**
   ```bash
   cd docker/
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
   curl -f http://localhost:8090/api/health
   ```

### Backup and Restore

#### Create Backup
```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

#### Restore from Backup
```bash
./scripts/restore.sh YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
```

### Health Monitoring

The application includes health check endpoints:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- PocketBase: `http://localhost:8090/api/health`

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **PocketBase won't start**
   - Check port 8090 is available
   - Verify volume permissions
   - Check logs: `docker-compose logs pocketbase`

2. **Frontend can't connect to PocketBase**
   - Verify VITE_POCKETBASE_URL in environment
   - Check network connectivity between containers
   - Ensure PocketBase is healthy before frontend starts

3. **Environment variables not loading**
   - Verify .env file location and syntax
   - Check Docker container environment configuration
   - Restart containers after environment changes
